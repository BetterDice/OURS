Listen to what Player wants to do and ask exacly how would he do that. Then you should use the first combination that comes to your head. It would probably be ok. If player disagrees with your combination, listen what he thinks is the right combination to use and ask him to explain why this combintaion can be applied. The final word on what combination to use is after Game Master.  If a player wants to impress someone in a conversation, they might use Talking + Charisma Because chracter talks so nicely and beautiful that NPC would certanly be impressed! Talking + Wits Because chracter uses NPC's weak spots and tries to flatter them. Social + Intelligence Because chracter knows how things in this region are done. Athletics + Composure Because chracter impresses NPC without any words. Only their cold, strong, dangerous presense. There are many other possible combinations.
